# About this repo

This repo is a collection of all the articles published in my personal blog written in markdown format, that way anyone who finds a typo or any kind of error can submit a PR to fix it.

You can find the posts written in English in [here](en), and in Spanish in [here](en).

Also, I would be very glad if you could give me a few minutes of your time and pass through my blog, there you will find information about me, who am I, the things what I do, and some of my opinions about trivial and untrivial things.
